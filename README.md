This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.3.

## Brief description
In this repository I'm showing you how smart and dumb component work.

## What is a smart and dumb component in Angular?
Well, there are a lot of information on internet so I'm going to define on my own words. Smart component refers to that component which is going to manage state and logic unlike dumb component is responsible for displaying something in the DOM.

Maybe it will be confuse for people learning Angular (ReactJS too) but as you move forward, this will be more understandable for you. It's easy, believe me.
